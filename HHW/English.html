    5) Papier Mâché

<br><br>i) Papier mâché was introduced in Kashmir in the 14th century by the Persian mystic Mir Syed Ali Hamdani.

<br>ii) There are two important aspects of Kashmiri papier mâché- Sakhtsazi and Naqashi. The first step, Sakhtsazi, involves making the foundation of the object with the paper pulp and Naqashi is the final step of painting and decoration.

    6) Shahtoosh Shawls

<br><br>i) It is also a metonym for a type of Kashmir shawl traditionally made of shahtoosh wool

<br>ii) They are warm enough to hatch a pigeon egg and a 2m long shawl is just 160g.

<br> iii) It is softer, lighter, and warmer than Pashmina making it expensive.

We have chosen these crafts of Kashmir as they are masterfully handcrafted and act as a major source of income for many Kashmiri families.
<br><br>
7) Pheran

<br><br>i) A Pheran made of wool is called a 'loch'.

<br>ii) Pheran was introduced by Mughal emperor Akbar in 1586.

<br>iii) Pheran is unisex but women love to wear the Tilla Pheran.

We have chosen this attire of Kashmir as it is the traditional clothing for the common people of the region and it holds great historic value
